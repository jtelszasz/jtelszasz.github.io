I"v<p>I’m lucky enough to be helping the City of Baltimore build a data-driven culture by serving as the <strong>Deputy Director and Analytics Lead</strong> for the <a href="https://www.baltopi.com/">Mayor’s Office of Performance and Innovation</a>. I’m also adjunct faculty at the Maryland Institute College of Art in their graduate <a href="https://www.mica.edu/graduate-programs/data-analytics-and-visualization-mps/">Data Analytics &amp; Visualization</a> program. <a href="'/assets/images/resume.pdf'">Here’s my resume</a>.</p>

<p>I’m married with two little kids. Enjoy road cycling, making and repairing things, reading, thinking, and generally not being on social media (except <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz/">LinkedIn</a>). Jurgen Klopp is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3gH72iBJYI">moral compass</a> this world needs right now.</p>
