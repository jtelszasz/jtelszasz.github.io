I"<p>I’m lucky enough to be helping the City of Baltimore build a data-driven culture by serving as the <strong>Deputy Director and Analytics Lead</strong> for the Mayor’s Office of Performance and Innovation.</p>

<p>I’m married with two little kids. Enjoy road cycling, reading, thinking, and generally not being on social media (except <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz/">LinkedIn</a>). Jurgen Klopp is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3gH72iBJYI">moral compass</a> this world needs right now.</p>
