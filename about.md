In 2024 I founded Good Enough, a small consulting practice supporting state and local governments through data, design, and innovation.

I recently served as Chief Data Officer and Interim Director for the Mayor's Office of Performance & Innovation for the [City of Baltimore](https://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/). I also previously taught at the Maryland Institute College of Art in their graduate [Data Analytics & Visualization](https://www.mica.edu/graduate-programs/data-analytics-and-visualization-mps/) program. My background is in mechanical engineering, and I have prior experience in energy systems and policy, aerospace, and design engineering.

I'm married with two little kiddos. I enjoy cycling, making and repairing things, reading, thinking, and generally not being on social media (except [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz/)). 

Here's a quick [bio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YV9a9LUMPcRLqWlIrI5RWEa1-SsrhnRFKkk5j_0VeAk/edit?usp=sharing).
