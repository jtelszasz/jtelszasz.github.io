I'm lucky enough to be helping the City of Baltimore build a data-driven culture by serving as the **Deputy Director and Analytics Lead** for the Mayor's Office of Performance and Innovation.  


I'm married with two little kids. Enjoy road cycling, reading, thinking, and generally not being on social media (except [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz/)). Jurgen Klopp is the [moral compass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3gH72iBJYI) this world needs right now.
