In 2024 I founded Good Enough, a small consulting practice supporting state and local governments through data, AI, design, and innovation. I'm also a board member for [Open Works](https://www.openworksbmore.org), the largest non-profit makerspace in the country, and a volunteer for [U.S. Digital Response](https://www.usdigitalresponse.org).

I served as Chief Data Officer and Interim Director for the Mayor's Office of Performance & Innovation for the [City of Baltimore](https://mayor.baltimorecity.gov/). I previously taught at the Maryland Institute College of Art in their graduate [Data Analytics & Visualization](https://www.mica.edu/graduate-programs/data-analytics-and-visualization-mps/) program. My background is in mechanical engineering, and I have prior experience in energy systems and policy, aerospace, and design engineering.

I'm married with two little kiddos. I enjoy cycling, making and repairing things, reading, thinking, and generally not being on social media (except [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz/)). 

Here's a quick [bio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YV9a9LUMPcRLqWlIrI5RWEa1-SsrhnRFKkk5j_0VeAk/edit?usp=sharing).
