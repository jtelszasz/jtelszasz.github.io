I'm lucky enough to be helping the City of Baltimore build a data-driven culture by serving as the **Deputy Director and Analytics Lead** for the [Mayor's Office of Performance and Innovation](https://www.baltopi.com/). I'm also adjunct faculty at the Maryland Institute College of Art in their graduate [Data Analytics & Visualization](https://www.mica.edu/graduate-programs/data-analytics-and-visualization-mps/) program. [Here's my resume]('/assets/images/resume.pdf').


I'm married with two little kids. Enjoy road cycling, making and repairing things, reading, thinking, and generally not being on social media (except [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz/)).
