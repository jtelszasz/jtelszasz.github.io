I'm lucky enough to be helping the City of Baltimore build a data-driven culture by serving as the **Deputy Director and Analytics Lead** for the [Mayor's Office of Performance and Innovation](https://www.baltopi.com/). I'm also adjunct faculty at the Maryland Institute College of Art in their graduate [Data Analytics & Visualization](https://www.mica.edu/graduate-programs/data-analytics-and-visualization-mps/) program.

I'm married with two little kids. Enjoy road cycling, making and repairing things, reading, thinking, and generally not being on social media (except [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz/)). 

Here's my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sahEjrJvEL0ZYC2l-hfgVQGLy8KGES1P/view?usp=sharing).

Here's a quick [bio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YV9a9LUMPcRLqWlIrI5RWEa1-SsrhnRFKkk5j_0VeAk/edit?usp=sharing).

Find me over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz).
