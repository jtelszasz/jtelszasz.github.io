My most recent role was as Chief Data Officer and Interim Director for the Mayor's Office of Performance & Innovation for the City of Baltimore. I also recently taught at the Maryland Institute College of Art in their graduate [Data Analytics & Visualization](https://www.mica.edu/graduate-programs/data-analytics-and-visualization-mps/) program.

I'm married with two little kiddos. I enjoy road cycling, making and repairing things, reading, thinking, and generally not being on social media (except [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinelszasz/)). 

Here's my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UmRYHn0LYQ-RYfXfZROk4f5pHHudk3FC/view?usp=sharing).

Here's a quick [bio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YV9a9LUMPcRLqWlIrI5RWEa1-SsrhnRFKkk5j_0VeAk/edit?usp=sharing).
